This project wraps the Microsoft.Data.SqlClient library to enhance interaction with a SQL Server database. These functions cover essential tasks like optimizing data transfer from a DataTable to a designated database table using bulk copying, executing SQL queries to consolidate data into a DataTable, extracting values from SQL queries, and executing non-query SQL statements.
